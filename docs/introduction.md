# Introduction to Arduino

## Course Types
There are three types of courses in the CoderDojo Twin Cities Arudino:

1. **Online Courses** - These courses are taught in virtual environments and don't require any hardware for our students.  We use web sites like TinkerCad to simulate the behavior of Arduino devices.
2. **Hardware Courses** - These courses require you to have general Arduino hardware and sensors used by the students or mentors. Note that you can still teach these courses online.  Many of the hardware lab programs can also be simulated online.
3. **Project Courses** - These courses often require a specific combination of hardware that the students will build for example a Simon or Pong game.  

Each of the hardware courses are designed to use low-cost Arduino hardware.  We use low-cost Arduino Nanos for many labs since they can be purchased for around $2.50USD.

## Pre-course setup
The online courses don't require any physical setup.  However, you should have the parents create an account on TinkerCad and learn how to save and run sample programs.  See the Introduction section for each course for details.

## Getting the Right Hardware
If you are a good planner and willing to do some work you can get very low-cost parts from China at a fraction of the prices you see in kits.  Just remember that the parts should be ordered 2-3 weeks before your courses start.

For the Hardware Courses here are the typical components you will use:


| Part Name   |  Description      | Price | Link   | Note |
|-------------|-------------------|------:|--------|------|
| Arduino Nano| Arduino Nano ATmega328 CH340G Mini USB. The main processor in a low-cost and breadboard-friendly package | $2.50 each | [ebay - solder your own](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Nano-V3-0-Mini-USB-ATmega328-5V-16M-Micro-controller-CH340G-board-For-Arduino/202988007585) | Note this version will require you to solder on the headers. |
| Mini USB Cable | Short Mini USB cable for connecting the Arduino to the PC's USB port | $1.00 | [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/1-2-5-10PCS-Mini-Type-C-Micro-USB-Nano-V3-0-5V-ATmega328-CH340G-Kit-For-Arduino/143495610440) | check you computer to see what type of cable you need |
| 400 Tie Solderless Breadboard | This 1/2 size breadboard has 400 ties and is big enough for most beginning projects.  It is also small enough for students to carry in a backpack | $1.50 each | [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Solderless-Breadboard-400-Point-Tie-Prototype-Test-Bread-Board-PCB-For-Arduino/283953769724) | The Nano fits directly into this breadboard |
| LEDs | 100 LEDs of various colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White). At $1 for 100 LEDs you can stop worrying about burning a few out | $1 for 100 | [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Blue-Green-Red-White-Yellow-LED-Light-Bulb-Emitting-Diode-Lamps-100pcs-3mm/392695822918) |  |
| 330 Ohm Resistors | This package of 100 should be enough for most classrooms | $1.25 for 100 | [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/100PCS-1-4W-0-25W-Metal-Film-Resistor-1-Full-Range-of-Values-0-to-10M/252838503547) | 330 ohms are perfect for connecting an LED to a 5-volt source |
| Breadboard Jumper Wires | 65 Male-to-Male jumpers of various lengths | $2.50 for 65 | [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/65Pcs-Male-to-Male-Breadboard-Jumper-Cable-Wires-Kit-for-Arduino-Circuit-Set/264315948957)| Reuse for many projects |
| Ping Sensor | HC-SR04 Ultrasonic distance sensor.  There are many sensors priced much higher but this will work fine for our projects | $1.50 each | [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/1pcs-Ultrasonic-Module-HC-SR04-Distance-Measuring-Transducer-Sensor-for-Arduino/402321340688) |  |


## Sample Starter Kits

### Basic Starter Kit
We understand that not every school wants to purchase individual components that may 2-3 weeks to arrive from China.  If you need a kit quickly and are willing to compromise on component choice and cost here are some options that usually ship from Amazon in under a week.

This kit from ELEGOO is inexpensive but lacks some of the basic sensores such as a ping sensor.

# Arduino Uno Labs

We are currently using the SparkFun Uno labs from their online guide.  These guides are

## Blink
In this lab we make an LED turn on and off every second.<br/>

## Potentiometer
We hook a potentiometer to our breadboard to change the frequency of the LED blinking.  As you turn the know the speed of the blinking changes.
We learn how to map the values from the input analog port into the a delay of the LED in milliseconds.<br/>

## Photoresistor
This is the first lab where we sense the environment.  A photoreistor is used to measure the amount of light.<br/>

## RGB LED Lab
Our students LOVE these Red-Green-Blue LEDs since they can make any color of the rainbow by changing the combination of colors.  Our Kits
use common cathode LEDs.<br/>

## Sound
In this lab we use a combination of buttons and buttons to generate sounds.  We can also create a Simon game with the LEDs and buttons.<br/>

# Ping Lab
In this lab we use an ultrasonic distance sensor (called a ping sensor) to measure the distance between our sensor and an object in front
of it.  These sensors are low-cost (around $2 each) are are used in our robots.<br/>

# Servo Lab
In this lab we use a low-cost servo motor to demonstrate how an Arduino can control the angle of a servo motor.

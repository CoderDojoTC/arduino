# Learning to Program Arduino with Tinkercad(TM)

We will be using Autocad's web-based tool [TinkerCad(TM)](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to learn how to program with an Arduino.  This is a good way to get started if you are doing online mentoring or if you have difficulty installing customized
Arduino drivers or the Arduino IDE on your computer.

Here are the labs we will do:

## Blink
Make a single LED go on and off.  We will also learn about how to wire up an LED using a current limiting resistor so we don't burn out our LEDs.  You can go to the lab by clicking [here](./01-blink.md) or use the navigation menu on the left to get to this lab.

## Blink Three LEDs
Make two or more LEDs blink with various patterns.  Click [here](./02-blink-three-leds.md) to go to the lab.

## Change Blink Speed with a Potentiometer
Use a potentiometer to change the frequency of a flashing LED.
Click [here](./03-change-blink-speed.md)

## RGB LED
Use an RGB LED to make all the colors of the rainbow.
Click [here](./04-rgb-led.md)

## Ping Sensor
Measure the distance using an ultrasonic ping sensor.  This will be very useful when we want to build a collision-avoidance robot.

## Photo Sensor
Use a photoresistor to measure how much light is present in a room.

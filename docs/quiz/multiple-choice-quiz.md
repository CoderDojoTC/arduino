# Multiple Choice Quiz
The following is a multiple choice quiz for junior high school students learning Arduino

#### What is the purpose of the start() function?

1. Starts a power up sequence on the Arduino
2. Starts gathering data on input pins
3. Initializes memory before the main loop() (Correct)
4. Begins to generate test data

#### What does the loop() function do?

1. Begins the multi-threaded execution function
2. Runs the main program continually until a power off or reset event (Correct)
3. Resets the loop variables
4. Looks for the main() function in memory

#### What is the correct syntax for the for statement?

1. for i in range(max): print i
2. for (i=0, i<max, i++) {print i}
3. for i, i<max, i++) {print i}
4. for (i=0, i<max>, i++) {print(i)} (Correct)

#### How do you read a digital value from a pin?

1.

### Response
#### What is the purpose of the "if" statement? 
1. To execute a block of code if a condition is true or false (Correct) 
2. To run a block of code if the value on an input pin is greater than 5 volts 
3. To run a block of code if the value on an input pin is less than 5 volts 
4. To run a block of code if the value on an input pin equals 5 volts

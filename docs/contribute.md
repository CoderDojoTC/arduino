# Contributing CoderDojo Twin Cities Arduino Resources

We are an all-volunteer group of mentors, teachers and programmers that love the help children learn about the wonders of computer science.  We think that
Arduino programming is one of the best ways to keep our students engaged in STEM programs.

But we can't do this without your help!

We need a variety of people with many different skills and interests.  If you are not a programmer, that is OK.  We still have many tasks you can help us with.

Here are just a few items we need help with:

1. **Organizing special events**  Are you good at organizing?  We need you!  For example every year we teach girls how to use Arduino to create colorful Arduino costumes.
2. **Reviewing Content**  Got a knack for grammar?  We can always use help editing our growing library of Arduino materials.
3. **Course Design**  Are you good at designing courses for students?  We have many groups that would like to repackage our Arduino materials for specific groups such as girls in scouts, local programming clubs, environmental organizations, or schools that have specific curriculum needs.
4. **Usability testing**  Would you like to pretend you are a student? Just try to go through our labs and see what you like or don't like.  The tell us what we can improve.
5. **Mentoring Students** Every year CoderDojo is flooded with students that would like to learn coding.  We never have enough mentors.  Even if you don't have strong computer programming skills we think you can be a great mentor for our students.

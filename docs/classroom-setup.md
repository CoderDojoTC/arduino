# CoderDojo Twin Cities Arduino Classroom Setup
If you are going to attend one of our in-classroom classes, please note the following.

## Use our existing computers
The computers in our labs have the Arduino IDE installed and there are Sparkfun Inventor Kits available.
You just need to plug the Arduino Uno into the USB port using the cables in the boxes.  This is the preferred method for most students.

## Bringing Your Own Computer to our Labs
We encourage parents students to bring their own computer if they are working on longer-term Arduino projects at home.
In order for you to get the most out of the class we encourage you to try the following three steps BEFORE you arrive.

### Step 1: Download the Arduino IDE

Please try to pre-load the [Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).  
This free software will run on Windows, Mac and Linux systems. If you are familiar with Eclipse, this is a version of Eclipse that has been extensively customized for the Arduino. The IDE comes pre-loaded with many sample programs. If you have questions about how to use the application please see the Arduino web site. There are also many YouTube videos that show you how the Arduino system work.

### Step 2: Download the SparkFun Inventors Kit Example Code

We also would like you to pre-load the [SparkFun Inventors Kit Code Examples](http://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/datasheets/Kits/SIK%20Guide%20Code.zip) so the student doesn't need to type in the code.

1. Download the latest SIK Guide Code (http://sparkfun.com/sikcode)
2. Unzip the above file
3. Place the "SIK Guide Code" folder in the Arduino IDE "examples" directory:<br/>

For PC: drag the "SIK Guide Code" folder into C:\program files\Arduino-x\examples<br/>

For MAC: drag the "SIK Guide Code" folder into Arduino-x/Contents/Resource/Java/examples<br/>

For Linux: see http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Learning/Linux<br/>

4. Start the Arduino IDE; the examples should be visible in File/Examples/SIK Guide Code

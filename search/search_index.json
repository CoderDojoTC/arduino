Make sure you put a 330-ohm current limiting resistor between the LED and the digital output or a 5-volt connection. Arduino Arduino is the name of a popular open electronic learning platform based around a set of open standards. Cathode The negative side of our LEDs. Make sure that the cathode always goes to the ground (GND) pin or rail. It is a best practice to use a black wire to connect the cathode to ground. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software program used for writing, checking and downloading software into the Arduino. Pulse Wave Modulation (PWM) A way of controlling the speed of a motor or the intensity of a light by changing the amount of time a signal is on. On the Arduino only a subset of output pins can be used to send PWM signals. On the Arduino Nano these are pins 3,5,6,9, 10 and 11. Arduino Nano The original Arduino devices have a defect in that they are not compatible with standardized solderless breadboards. We use a lower-cost version that can plug in directly to a solderless breadboard. * Hardware Web Page * Guide to the Arduino Nano CH340 The name of the low-cost USB interface chip that is use instead of the more expensive FTDI USB interface chip. Although the chip is low cost, the driver is not usually included with the Arduino IDE and the driver is not digitally sigined for the Mac. See the CH340 drivers here See Arduino Nano CH340 Instructable for a good description of how to make the CH340 work on the Mac. Light Emitting Diode A solid-state device that emits light when a voltage is applied. LEDs come in various colors such as red, green and blue. In our labs we will use various colors of LEDs that all use around 20 milliamps of current. To make sure that there is not too much current going through the LED we always use a 330-ohm resistor in series with the LEDs. Also known as: LED Wikipedia Definition Moving Rainbow Kits These are kits that combine three important aspects of learning: Color, Motion and Social Constructionism. Students are interested in sensing and changing the world around them. The use of low-cost LEDs and DC-motors can make these kits not only fun, but inexpensive enough that students can purchase them and take them home to share with friends. A typical cost is around $15.00 USD. Web site: https://dmccreary.gitbooks.io/moving-rainbow/ Red-Green-Blue LED (RGB LED) A single device that has three colors of LEDs. One for red, one for blue and one for green. By combining various intensities of each of these three colors we can create many additional colors.

We purchased ten SparkFun Inventors Kids (SIK) for around $110 each. These kits served us well for about a year and then we found our needs growing. We wanted students to be able to do complete projects and then be able to take their kits home and show their students and friends. Most of our students could not afford to spend over $100 on an electronics kit. Their parents were not sure they would use the kits more than once or twice. Our solution was to source low-cost Arduino kits that students could afford to purchase and keep. Our target prices was $25 US. We are happy to report that we now have fun kits as low as $15 that students have used to learn many computer science concepts. Getting Low-Cost Hardware In Time For Classes If you are a good planner and willing to do some work you can get very low-cost parts from China at a fraction of the prices you see in kits. Just remember that the parts should be ordered 2-3 weeks before your courses start. For the Hardware Courses here are the typical components you will use: Part Name Description Price Link Note Arduino Nano Arduino Nano ATmega328 CH340G Mini USB. The main processor in a low-cost and breadboard-friendly package. Some version require you to solder in your own header pins and some are \"pre-welded\" meaning the headers are soldered in. $2.50 each ebay - solder your own Note this version will require you to solder on the headers. Mini USB Cable Short Mini USB cable for connecting the Arduino to the PC's USB port $1.00 ebay check you computer to see what type of cable you need 400 Tie Solderless Breadboard This 1/2 size breadboard has 400 ties and is big enough for most beginning projects. It is also small enough for students to carry in a backpack $1.50 each ebay The Nano fits directly into this breadboard LEDs 100 LEDs of various colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White). At $1 for 100 LEDs you can stop worrying about burning a few out $1 for 100 ebay 330 Ohm Resistors This package of 100 should be enough for most classrooms $1.25 for 100 ebay 330 ohms are perfect for connecting an LED to a 5-volt source Breadboard Jumper Wires 65 Male-to-Male jumpers of various lengths $2.50 for 65 ebay Reuse for many projects Ping Sensor HC-SR04 Ultrasonic distance sensor. There are many sensors priced much higher but this will work fine for our projects $1.50 each ebay Sample Starter Kits A Cautionary Tail Before we suggest kits we want to caution parents that spend a lot of money to purchase a fancy electronic kit that gets used once and then gets stuffed in the back of a closet. We have had many parents come to us and tell us stories of how frustrating it is to not be able to get circuits to work. Just one wire misconnected or one line of code wrong and students can quickly become frustrated. The solution is to always start slowly and use a mentor to guide your students over the frustrating parts of building circuits. This is especially true for the first six weeks of learning Arduino. After three or four mentoring session students will start to learn debugging techniques so they can solve their own problems. Basic Starter Kit We understand that not every school wants to purchase individual components that may 2-3 weeks to arrive from China. If you need a kit quickly and are willing to compromise on component choice and cost here are some options that usually ship from Amazon in under a week. ELEGOO Basic Starter Kit If you are not sure your students are interested in programming we suggest you start simple. Buy a low-cost kit and have your student work with a mentor for 2-3 months. After that time you will get a feel for if buying additional kits is a good educational investments. This kit from ELEGOO is inexpensive but lacks some of the basic sensores such as a ping sensor.

The Blink lab is kind of like \"Hello world!\" in Arduino: it is the first program most students learn. Getting blink working is not always easy. You will need to become familiar with using Tinkercad and entering code into the system before you can run the example. LED Connections The LED has two connectors on it. But you should never connect both the wires directly to power. That will burn out the LED. The LED has a negative side (called the Cathode) and a positive site (called the Anode). It is important that you always put a proper resistor in the path of the circuit to limit the current. In the case of a standard 5 volt Arduino we will use a 330-ohm resistor to limit the current to the LED. It is important that you don't confuse these two sides. If you don't hook them up correctly your circuit will not work! Here is a picture of the cathode and anode of an LED. Remembering Cathode and Anode Sometimes you can use a picture to help you remember which end is the cathode and which one is the anode. I try to think of a short black \"cat\" to remember the negative cathode. I also try to think of my friend Ann who is tall and loves red when I think of the Anode. Here is a picture that you can use to remember this idea: Sometimes it is hard to remember which side is which. You Circuit Diagram Here is the circuit diagram we will use for our blink lab. You can create this using the following steps: Step 1: Create a New Circuit Go to the left navigation area and click the Circuits and press the green Create New Circuit button: Step 2: Add an Arduino Uno Go to the right search area and type in \"Arduino\". You should see the following image: Now clink on the image and use your mouse to drag the icon of the Arduino to the main central area of your screen. Step 3: Add the LED and the resistor Now go back to the right-side search area and enter \"LED\". You should see an image like this: Note that in this diagram, the straight wire on the left is the cathode which goes to GND pin on the Arduino. The bent pin on the right is anode which goes through a resistor and then to a digital output pin. Step 4: Add the Resistor and Set it to be 330 ohms Finally, we will also add a resistor to our circuit. Go to the right side, type in \"resistor\" and you should see an image like this: Unlike the LED, the resistor is just a generic component but we must next set the value of the resistor to be 330 ohms. We do this by clicking directly on the resistor in the circut diagram and changing the value in the inspector region of the screen: Step 5: Make the connections Now we have our three components on the screen. We are ready to hook them up. First, lets connect the left side of the LED (the cathode) to the GND or ground negative pin of the Arduino. Once you have the wire connected you can select it and you will be able to change the color. My convention, any wire that go to GND are typically colord black. Now drag the 330 ohm resistor so it connect to the right pin of the LED and then add Your circuit should look like the following diagram: Code Almost all Arduino programs have two main functions: A setup function that runs once when the Aruduino powers up A loop function that runs continually until the power is turned off (or the reset is triggered) The Setup Function void setup () { pinMode ( 13 , OUTPUT ); } In our blink program the setup function just sets pin 13 as an output pin. That is pretty simple. You will notice that the word setup is followed by an open and a closed parenthesis. This is to indicate that there are no parameters going into the function. The Loop Function The loom function will do four functions Turn the voltage of pin 13 HIGH (+5 volts) Wait one second (1000 milliseconds) using the delay function Turn the voltage of pin 13 LOW (ground or 0 volts) Wait one second again It repeats the on/off every second continually until the power is turned off. void loop () { digitalWrite ( 13 , HIGH ); delay ( 1000 ); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s) digitalWrite ( 13 , LOW ); delay ( 1000 ); } The Full Program Here is the full program: void setup () { pinMode ( 13 , OUTPUT ); } void loop () { digitalWrite ( 13 , HIGH ); delay ( 1000 ); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s) digitalWrite ( 13 , LOW ); delay ( 1000 ); } You can type this into the Tinkercad program or do a copy here and paste it into the code area. Working example on Tinkercad Blink on Tinkercad Experiments What happens if you change the delay times (currently set at 1000) to be 100? What happens if you change the delay times to be 50? What happens if you change the delay times to be 20? What happens if you change the delay times to be 10? Can you still see the blinking at all? Food for thought Most movies are shown around shown at 24 frames per second? Why do you think they picked this speed? If you hook up a photo sensor to a florescent light bulb you will see that it flickers 120 times per second. Household current runs at half this rate (60 times per second). Why do you think that the light flicker rate is twice the frequency? Hint: draw a wave that goes positive and negative. Look up Sine Wave in Wikipedia. What did you learn about the human eye?

We use web sites like TinkerCad to simulate the behavior of Arduino devices. Hardware Courses - These courses require you to have general Arduino hardware and sensors used by the students or mentors. Note that you can still teach these courses online. Many of the hardware lab programs can also be simulated online. Project Courses - These courses often require a specific combination of hardware that the students will build for example a Simon or Pong game. Each of the hardware courses are designed to use low-cost Arduino hardware. We use low-cost Arduino Nanos for many labs since they can be purchased for around $2.50USD. Pre-course setup The online courses don't require any physical setup. However, you should have the parents create an account on TinkerCad and learn how to save and run sample programs. See the Introduction section for each course for details. Getting the Right Hardware If you are a good planner and willing to do some work you can get very low-cost parts from China at a fraction of the prices you see in kits. Just remember that the parts should be ordered 2-3 weeks before your courses start. For the Hardware Courses here are the typical components you will use: Part Name Description Price Link Note Arduino Nano Arduino Nano ATmega328 CH340G Mini USB. The main processor in a low-cost and breadboard-friendly package $2.50 each ebay - solder your own Note this version will require you to solder on the headers. Mini USB Cable Short Mini USB cable for connecting the Arduino to the PC's USB port $1.00 ebay check you computer to see what type of cable you need 400 Tie Solderless Breadboard This 1/2 size breadboard has 400 ties and is big enough for most beginning projects. It is also small enough for students to carry in a backpack $1.50 each ebay The Nano fits directly into this breadboard LEDs 100 LEDs of various colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White).

The Blink lab is kind of like \"Hello world!\" in Arduino: it is the first program most students learn. Getting blink working is not always easy. You will need to become familiar with using Tinkercad and entering code into the system before you can run the example. LED Connections The LED has two connectors on it. But you should never connect both the wires directly to power. That will burn out the LED. The LED has a negative side (called the Cathode) and a positive site (called the Anode). It is important that you always put a proper resistor in the path of the circut to limit the current. In the case of a standard 5 volt Arduino we will use a 330 ohm resistor to limit the current to the LED. It is important that you don't confuse these two sides. If you don't hook them up correctly your circuit will not work! Here is a picture of the cathode and anode of an LED. Remembering Cathode and Anode Sometimes you can use a picture to help you remember which end is the cathode and which one is the anode. I try to think of a short black \"cat\" to remember the negative cathode. I also try to think of my friend Ann who is tall and loves red when I think of the Anode. Here is a picture that you can use to remember this idea: Sometimes it is hard to remember which side is which. You Circuit Diagram Here is the circuit diagram we will use for our blink lab. You can create this using the following steps: Step 1: Create a New Circuit Go to the left navigation area and click the Circuits and press the green Create New Circuit button: Step 2: Add an Arduino Uno Go to the right search area and type in \"Arduino\". You should see the following image: Now clink on the image and use your mouse to drag the icon of the Arduino to the main central area of your screen. Step 3: Add the LED and the resistor Now go back to the right-side search area and enter \"LED\". You should see an image like this: Step 4: Add the Resistor and Set it to be 330 ohms Finally, we will also add a resistor to our circuit. Go to the right side, type in \"resistor\" and you should see an image like this: Unlike the LED, the resistor is just a generic component but we must next set the value of the resistor to be 330 ohms. We do this by clicking directly on the resistor in the circut diagram and changing the value in the inspector region of the screen: Step 5: Make the connections Now we have our three components on the screen. We are ready to hook them up. First, lets connect the left side of the LED (the cathode) to the GND or ground negative pin of the Arduino. Once you have the wire connected you can select it and you will be able to change the color. My convention, any wire that go to GND are typically colord black. Now drag the 330 ohm resistor so it connect to the right pin of the LED and then add Your circuit should look like the following diagram: Code Almost all Arduino programs have two main functions: A setup function that runs once when the Aruduino powers up A loop function that runs continually until the power is turned off (or the reset is triggered) The Setup Function void setup () { pinMode ( 13 , OUTPUT ); } In our blink program the setup function just sets pin 13 as an output pin. That is pretty simple. You will notice that the word setup is followed by an open and a closed parenthesis. This is to indicate that there are no parameters going into the function. The Loop Function The loom function will do four functions Turn the voltage of pin 13 HIGH (+5 volts) Wait one second (1000 milliseconds) using the delay function Turn the voltage of pin 13 LOW (ground or 0 volts) Wait one second again It repeats the on/off every second continually until the power is turned off. void loop () { digitalWrite ( 13 , HIGH ); delay ( 1000 ); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s) digitalWrite ( 13 , LOW ); delay ( 1000 ); } The Full Program Here is the full program: void setup () { pinMode ( 13 , OUTPUT ); } void loop () { digitalWrite ( 13 , HIGH ); delay ( 1000 ); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s) digitalWrite ( 13 , LOW ); delay ( 1000 ); } You can type this into the Tinkercad program or do a copy here and paste it into the code area. Working example on Tinkercad Blink on Tinkercad Experiments What happens if you change the delay times (currently set at 1000) to be 100? What happens if you change the delay times to be 50? What happens if you change the delay times to be 20? What happens if you change the delay times to be 10? Can you still see the blinking at all? Food for thought Most movies are shown around shown at 24 frames per second? Why do you think they picked this speed? If you hook up a photo sensor to a florescent light bulb you will see that it flickers 120 times per second. Household current runs at half this rate (60 times per second). Why do you think that the light flicker rate is twice the frequency? Hint: draw a wave that goes positive and negative. Look up Sine Wave in Wikipedia. What did you learn about the human eye?

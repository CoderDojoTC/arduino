# Learning to Program Arduino with Tingercad

We will be using TinkerCad to learn how to program with an Arduino.

Here are the labs we will do:

## Blink
Make a single LED go on and off.

## Blink Multiple LEDs
Make two or more LEDs blink with various patterns.

## Potentiometer
Use a potentiometer to change the frequency of a flashing LED.

## Ping Sensor
Measure the distance using an ultrasonic ping sensor.  This will be very useful when we want to build a collision-avoidance robot.

## Photo Sensor
Use a photoresistor to measure how much light is present in a room.
